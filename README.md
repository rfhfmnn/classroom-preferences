# Analyzing political preferences in the classroom

This project, developed as part of the Political Economy course at the Faculty of Economic Sciences (National University of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina), investigates political preferences. It employs a framework inspired by the Political Compass, adapted with custom criteria, to analyze the positioning of students. Additionally, it explores single-peaked preferences and vote transfer patterns in the context of Argentina's 2023 presidential election.

## Data and technologies

The analysis leverages class-made polls and utilizes ggplot2 for visualizations and dplyr for data manipulation to provide insights into voter behavior and political alignment. Anyway, I'll try to re-write every code in Python.
