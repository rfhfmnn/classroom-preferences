# classroom-preferences

This project, developed as part of the Political Economy course at the Faculty of Economic Sciences (National University of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina), focuses on analyzing political preferences. It explores the positioning of students within a framework inspired by the Political Compass, adapted using custom criteria. Additionally, it examines single-peaked preferences and vote transfer patterns in the context of Argentina's 2023 presidential election.
